# Free-Trail-Bypass
Hi all This is Upendra Yadav(Security Researcher). Today I am going to share one of my interesting findings where I am able to use Free Trail account for life Time Process. Come let’s start…

Overview Of Vulnerability:
A vulnerability has been identified in the free trial registration process that allows users to circumvent the intended trial period limits. By using email aliasing (e.g., adding +1 or +2 to the email address), users can continuously obtain new 14-day free trials without restriction. This issue arises because the system does not differentiate between the primary email address and its aliased versions, leading to potential indefinite access to premium features

Steps to Reproduce:
Initial Registration:
Visit the website and register for a free trial using the email address (e.g., testmail@gmail.com)
Verify that you receive a confirmation email and have access to the premium features for 7 or 14 days.
Bypass Trial Limit:
After the initial trial period expires, register for a new free trial using an same email address, but byadding +1 after your primary email (e.g., testmail+1@gmail.com,testmail+2@gmail.com,testmail+3@gmail.com).
Verify that a new 14-day trial is granted and that notifications and correspondence are sent to the primary email address (testmail@gmail.com).
Repeat Process:
Continue using different aliases (e.g., testmail+1@gmail.com,testmail+2@gmail.com,testmail+3@gmail.com, etc.) to obtain additional free trials.
Expected Result: The system should detect and prevent the use of email aliases to register for multiple free trials, ensuring that each email address is only eligible for a single trial period.

Actual Result: The system allows the creation of new free trial accounts using email aliases, granting new 14-day trials without restriction and sending notifications to the primary email address.

Recommendation: To address this issue, implement mechanisms to detect and prevent the use of email aliases for extending free trials. Consider validating email addresses against a blacklist of known aliases or implementing additional checks to enforce fair usage of the free trial offer.

Impact:
This vulnerability poses several business risks:

Revenue Loss: Users can exploit the bypass to access premium features indefinitely without paying, potentially resulting in significant revenue loss for the company.
Resource Drain: The increased number of free trial accounts from this bypass could strain the company’s infrastructure and support resources, leading to higher operational costs.
Pricing Model Undermined: The ability to continually extend free trials undermines the company’s pricing strategy by allowing users to access services that are meant to be available only through paid subscriptions.
Compliance Risks: There may be compliance issues if the misuse of free trials affects revenue reporting or breaches any contractual obligations related to promotional offers.
